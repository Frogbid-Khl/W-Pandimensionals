There are significant doubts that this is actually his real name. In fact, his whole history is a point of conjecture, as although he speaks a great deal, he never speaks of his past. Nobody is sure of his exact origins, but his strange accent would indicate he is from the eastern part of Europe or one of the Baltic states. And, as with most permanent inhabitants of Broadcliffs, his primary objective will not be what seems immediately apparent. That is to say, I doubt he is here to really sell chip sandwiches. If I do manage to find his real goal, I will update this entry. A piece of information which might prove useful, if only to secure some kind of discount.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>*******************************************<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Owner of the Chip Butty Bar, Hooney McStroots and a monarchist. He loves the Queen of England. He is a tall man and skinny with it. His face is gaunt and always covered in a thick black stubble, that never seems to grow into a full beard. His eyes are sunk deep into his head, and he has thick eyebrows, that bristled like a pair of mating caterpillars. His hair is longish and receding slightly, always greased back, and stuck in wedges to his spotty neck. He\u2019s usual angry about something.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_post_nav in_same_term=&#8221;on&#8221; prev_text=&#8221;Previous&#8221; next_text=&#8221;Next&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; title_font_size=&#8221;18px&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;50px||||false|false&#8221; global_module=&#8221;2210&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][\/et_pb_post_nav][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_sidebar area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_1&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; header_font=&#8221;Rubik|||on|||||&#8221; header_text_color=&#8221;gcid-ffd783fe-b482-420a-b0d6-59831d7e35a9&#8243; header_font_size=&#8221;21px&#8221; header_letter_spacing=&#8221;0.5px&#8221; body_text_color=&#8221;gcid-90156a12-9f1f-4767-a26a-19c14ad40e77&#8243; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;dark&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{%22gcid-ffd783fe-b482-420a-b0d6-59831d7e35a9%22:%91%22header_text_color%22%93,%22gcid-90156a12-9f1f-4767-a26a-19c14ad40e77%22:%91%22body_text_color%22%93}&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kalaxion Invasion Guide EYES ONLY\u00a0 Encryption code AZ+3 REF (23\/22) Division 66bd\/Subsection Orientation Basic Primary Clause: Notable Figures ******************************************* Mr. Hooney McStroot.
