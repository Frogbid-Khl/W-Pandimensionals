The first obvious answer is what it is known to be: a Pub ( a public house where you imbibe alcoholic beverages). Or perhaps the better description is that it was a Pub.<\/p>\n<p>How it is that the place is still in the public consciousness of the denizens of <a href=\"\/broadcliffs-town\/\">Broadcliffs<\/a> nearly a century after its demise? It is without a doubt that the site is one of the greatest legends of the town.<\/p>\n<p>There are several aspects to the Merry Dance that seemingly defy description. For a start, the exact location itself is a well-guarded secret. The last physical remains of the building itself were destroyed in the early part of the twentieth century to make way for a car park.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.pandimensionals.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/merry-Dance-Sq-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"The Merry Dance\" class=\"wp-image-3066 alignnone size-medium\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.pandimensionals.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/merry-Dance-Sq.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.pandimensionals.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/merry-Dance-Sq-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Because we know that The Merry Dance no longer has a physical location in Broadcliffs, we can ask, where was it? Archaeological findings pre-date the place before humans even started dating things. Because although now the site where it once rested is a car park, it was not always so. The ground may now be black with tarmac, but once it was red with blood.<\/p>\n<p>For many hundreds of years, a popular form of killing people was hanging. It involved a noose being tied at the end of a rope. The human had its head placed into the loop and was made to fall a certain height. This would result in their eventual death, pretty much most of the time. Humans considered this act was a spectacle worth watching.<\/p>\n<p>In a rare act of kindness, it was the tradition in Broadcliffs that the condemned man, or woman, was allowed one last alcoholic beverage before their big moment.<\/p>\n<p>This was served in the Merry Dance, named after the crowd&#8217;s favourite part of the show, the final act. The victim&#8217;s body, deprived of its so essential air, would go into a fit of jerking and spasming.<\/p>\n<p>A very Merry Dance indeed.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_post_nav in_same_term=&#8221;on&#8221; prev_text=&#8221;Previous&#8221; next_text=&#8221;Next&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; title_font_size=&#8221;18px&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;50px||||false|false&#8221; global_module=&#8221;2210&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][\/et_pb_post_nav][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_sidebar area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_1&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; header_font=&#8221;Rubik|||on|||||&#8221; header_text_color=&#8221;gcid-ffd783fe-b482-420a-b0d6-59831d7e35a9&#8243; header_font_size=&#8221;21px&#8221; header_letter_spacing=&#8221;0.5px&#8221; body_text_color=&#8221;gcid-90156a12-9f1f-4767-a26a-19c14ad40e77&#8243; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;dark&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{%22gcid-ffd783fe-b482-420a-b0d6-59831d7e35a9%22:%91%22header_text_color%22%93,%22gcid-90156a12-9f1f-4767-a26a-19c14ad40e77%22:%91%22body_text_color%22%93}&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kalaxion Invasion Guide EYES ONLY\u00a0 Encryption code AZ+3 REF (23\/22) Division 66bd\/Subsection Orientation Basic Primary Clause: Legends and Locations ******************************************* What exactly is the Merry Dance?
