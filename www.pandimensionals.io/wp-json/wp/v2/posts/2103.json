This term is itself quite a misnomer, like the drink, with its\u2019 heady cocktail of high sugar levels and strange collection of chemical compounds, is anything but soft.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is due to the unique chemical structure of the beverage and inclusion of the compounds anthocyanin, propylene glycol, and traces of formaldehyde that it is so highly sought out by the <a href=\"\/phanackapans\/\">Phanackapan<\/a> community of <a href=\"\/broadcliffs-town\/\">Broadcliffs<\/a>; that and the fact they like the taste, apparently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cherryade is used by the Phanackapans in their cultural events. Their society is based on production, and their output, in manufacturing terms, is phenomenal. As hard as they work, they also put as much effort into having a good time. Work hard, play hard is an Earth expression, yet one which applies to the Phanackapans all too readily. These so-called cultural events, or as they are better known, \u2018raves,\u2019 can last for days. Cherryade is a central part of this, due to its effects on the biochemistry of the Phanackpans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This drink allows criminal gangs to trade with the Phanackapans, as it is one of the very few commodities they cannot construct themselves. And due to the diminutive stature of Phanackapans, even small amounts of the fluid can be very lucrative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">For example, a can of the drink (around 330 ml) will procure you several thousand pounds worth of counterfeit goods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Of course, not all Cherryade is the same. Qualities can vary, and the most sort after is now the defunct brand called Corona. Bottles of Corona can fetch high prices on the black market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In shady deals, down darkened alleys, bottles of the liquid are exchanged for large sums of money. This has heightened the often violent demand and led to the horrors of \u2018bathtub cherryade.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is the gangs of Rose Town that fiercely control the flow of the liquid. The goods produced by this trade are locally known as \u2018countie.\u2019 These items can be a straight copy of the object or can sometimes contain modifications tailored to the buyers need. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Although rare, it has been known for a Phanackapan, after imbibing a little too much Cherryade, to add specific features absent from the original design schematic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The most tragic example of this is the loss of a family of four while watching a particularly nail-biting episode of Downton Abbey. The television involved, a 40\u2019\u2019 flat screen 3D Smart TV, that had been upgraded to include a trans-visual neural relay. Although true that the modification significantly increased the picture quality and resolution, it did so by beaming the images directly into the minds of the viewers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The shock at Lady Violet Crawley\u2019s surprise betrothal to the Italian Count proved too much,\u00a0<\/span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">melting the brains<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0of Mr Nigel Haversack, his wife Valerie, and their two children Michael, and Sandra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_post_nav in_same_term=&#8221;on&#8221; prev_text=&#8221;Previous&#8221; next_text=&#8221;Next&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; title_font_size=&#8221;18px&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;50px||||false|false&#8221; global_module=&#8221;2210&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][\/et_pb_post_nav][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_sidebar area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_1&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; header_font=&#8221;Rubik|||on|||||&#8221; header_text_color=&#8221;gcid-ffd783fe-b482-420a-b0d6-59831d7e35a9&#8243; header_font_size=&#8221;21px&#8221; header_letter_spacing=&#8221;0.5px&#8221; body_text_color=&#8221;gcid-90156a12-9f1f-4767-a26a-19c14ad40e77&#8243; text_orientation=&#8221;left&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;dark&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{%22gcid-ffd783fe-b482-420a-b0d6-59831d7e35a9%22:%91%22header_text_color%22%93,%22gcid-90156a12-9f1f-4767-a26a-19c14ad40e77%22:%91%22body_text_color%22%93}&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kalaxion Invasion Guide EYES ONLY\u00a0 Encryption code AZ+3 REF (23\/22) Division 66bd\/Subsection Orientation Basic Primary Clause: Legends ******************************************* He who controls the Cherryade controls Broadcliffs.
