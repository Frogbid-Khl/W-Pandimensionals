(\u201cPTCo.,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our website, located at https:\/\/www.pandimensionals.io (the \u201cSite\u201d) and online services (collectively, the \u201cService\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Types of Data We Collect. \u201cPersonal Data\u201d means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. \u201cAnonymous Data\u201d means data, including aggregated and de-identified data, that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Information You Provide Us.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail and mailing addresses, Ethereum address when you contact us or make a purchase from our website.<br \/>If you use our Services on your mobile device, we may collect your phone number and the unique device id number.<\/p>\n<p>Certain Services, such as two-factor authentication, may require our collection of your phone number. We may associate that phone number to your mobile device identification information.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.<\/p>\n<p>We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, Ethereum address, and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services.<\/p>\n<p>We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our Service that state that PersonalData is being collected.<\/p>\n<p>Information Collected via Technology. As you navigate through and interact with our Service, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:<\/p>\n<p>Information Collected by Our Servers. To make our Service more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, Ethereum address, wallet type, and\/or a date\/time stamp for your visit.<\/p>\n<p>Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (\u201cISP\u201d), referring\/exit pages, operating system, date\/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyse trends, administer the Service, track users\u2019 movements around the Service, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users\u2019 needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Service, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. \u201cCookies\u201d are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer\u2019s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Service. This type of information is collected to make the Service more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.<\/p>\n<p>Pixel Tag. In addition, we use \u201cPixel Tags\u201d (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users\u2019 Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. We do not currently respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals or other mechanisms that might enable Users to opt out of tracking on our site.<\/p>\n<p>Analytics Services. In addition to the tracking technologies we place, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you visit our Service. This includes third party analytics services, including but not limited to Google Analytics (\u201cAnalytics Services\u201d), that we engage to help analyse how users use the Service. We may receive reports based on these parties\u2019 use of these tools on an individual or aggregate basis. We use the information we get from Analytics Services only to improve our Service. The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Service (the \u201cAnalytics Information\u201d) is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf.
