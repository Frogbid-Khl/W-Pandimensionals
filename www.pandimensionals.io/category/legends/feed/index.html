<p>Beggar&#8217;s Square is located in the oldest part of <a href="/broadcliffs-town/">Broadcliffs</a>, known unimaginatively as Old Town. The place itself is an odd assortment of buildings throughout human history. Ancient castle ramparts jut from timber-framed houses.</p>
<p>Beggar&#8217;s Square can be found at the base of the mound that leads up to the castle grounds. And for thousands of years, it was a place of execution.</p></div>

<p class="p1"><strong>REF (23/22) Division 66bd/Subsection Orientation Basic Primary Clause: Notable Figures / Legends</strong></p>
<p>*******************************************</p>
<p>Humans and non-humans cease to exist in <a href="broadcliffs-town/">Broadcliffs</a> on a frighteningly regular basis. Sometimes the bodies are found, sometimes bits of the bodies are found, sometimes bits of the bodies are found in different locations, but most of the time, they just simply disappear.</p>
<p>This, as you can imagine, causes a certain amount of distress to the nearest and dearest of the departed.</p>
<p>Humans have found a coping strategy, and they call it revenge. After early experiments with this concept, they discovered that doing it in groups often ended in much better results. Thus was born the angry mob. Over time these groups became better organised and labelled themselves to gain a certain, shall we say, authority.</p>
<p>Broadcliffs has several groups like this; the primary and less effective are known as the Police, their role seems to be that of self-preservation. After this group, there are the Secret Police, followed by the Clandestine Police, and the not so secret World Government Organisations.</p>
<p>In times of extreme peril, these are backed up by the military and their special forces.</p>
<p>On the top of the pile of these types of groups, we have the fanatical Council Workers and their elite strike force of the Park Keepers. All of which is, of course, too busy to help the local residents, i.e. the people they are paid to protect.</p>
<p>So, where does this leave the average denizen of Broadcliffs? Alone? Abandoned, destined to die a horrible death? Yes, probably, but they can rest in the knowledge that they shall be avenged due primarily to the Neighbourhood Watch. Believed to be the Militant wing of the Committee of Dubious Goals, the Broadcliffs neighbourhood watch sticks more closely to those age-old traditions of angry mobs, distributing swift and often blind justice.</p>
<p>Pitchforks and torches are optional, although preferred as a nod to its ancient traditions.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that this noble organisation is riven with internal politics, as was clearly demonstrated on the Great Purge of 2013, which took place during the Greenfield Park Summer Village Fete. The ornamental paths of the old English gardens ran red with blood that day.</p>
<p>The altercation started over a debate on a judge&#8217;s impartiality in the Jams and preserves section of the annual Broadcliffs bake-off. Voices were raised in the judging pavilion, and harsh words were said. This very quickly escalated, and old tensions and rivalries rose to the surface.</p>
<p>The Girl Guides (with their terrifying and bizarre initiation rites) made short work of the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Broadcliffs Scout packs. It also saw the demise of the once fearsome Knitting and Crochet society in what turned out to be the mutual destruction of the Cat&#8217;s Protection League.</p>
<p>The subsequent loss of life, limbs, and subscription fees left the Rotary Club a shadow of this once fearsome organisation.</p>
<p>As the smoke cleared and the cries for mercy were silenced, one clear victor emerged triumphant on the battlefield. Armed only with a palette knife and a lemon zester, one Mrs Christine Cooper and her ragged band of psychopaths from the Women&#8217;s Institute arts and crafts division took the field that day.</p>
<p>Since then, she has ruled the organisation with cold, ruthless efficiency.</div>

<p class="p1"><strong>REF (23/22) Division 66bd/Subsection Orientation Basic Primary Clause: Legends</strong></p>
<p>*******************************************<strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He who controls the Cherryade controls Broadcliffs.</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The above is a famous Broadcliffs saying, although an over-exaggeration, the flow of Cherryade is an essential resource to the criminal underworld of the town.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cherryade is what humans refer to as a soft drink. This term is itself quite a misnomer, like the drink, with its’ heady cocktail of high sugar levels and strange collection of chemical compounds, is anything but soft. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is due to the unique chemical structure of the beverage and inclusion of the compounds anthocyanin, propylene glycol, and traces of formaldehyde that it is so highly sought out by the <a href="/phanackapans/">Phanackapan</a> community of <a href="/broadcliffs-town/">Broadcliffs</a>; that and the fact they like the taste, apparently.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cherryade is used by the Phanackapans in their cultural events. Their society is based on production, and their output, in manufacturing terms, is phenomenal. As hard as they work, they also put as much effort into having a good time. Work hard, play hard is an Earth expression, yet one which applies to the Phanackapans all too readily. These so-called cultural events, or as they are better known, ‘raves,’ can last for days. Cherryade is a central part of this, due to its effects on the biochemistry of the Phanackpans.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This drink allows criminal gangs to trade with the Phanackapans, as it is one of the very few commodities they cannot construct themselves. And due to the diminutive stature of Phanackapans, even small amounts of the fluid can be very lucrative.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For example, a can of the drink (around 330 ml) will procure you several thousand pounds worth of counterfeit goods.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Of course, not all Cherryade is the same. Qualities can vary, and the most sort after is now the defunct brand called Corona. Bottles of Corona can fetch high prices on the black market.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In shady deals, down darkened alleys, bottles of the liquid are exchanged for large sums of money. This has heightened the often violent demand and led to the horrors of ‘bathtub cherryade.’</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is the gangs of Rose Town that fiercely control the flow of the liquid. The goods produced by this trade are locally known as ‘countie.’ These items can be a straight copy of the object or can sometimes contain modifications tailored to the buyers need. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although rare, it has been known for a Phanackapan, after imbibing a little too much Cherryade, to add specific features absent from the original design schematic.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The most tragic example of this is the loss of a family of four while watching a particularly nail-biting episode of Downton Abbey. The television involved, a 40’’ flat screen 3D Smart TV, that had been upgraded to include a trans-visual neural relay. Although true that the modification significantly increased the picture quality and resolution, it did so by beaming the images directly into the minds of the viewers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The shock at Lady Violet Crawley’s surprise betrothal to the Italian Count proved too much, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">melting the brains</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of Mr Nigel Haversack, his wife Valerie, and their two children Michael, and Sandra.</span></p></div>

<p class="p1"><strong>REF (23/22) Division 66bd/Subsection Orientation Basic Primary Clause: Notable figures and Legends</strong></p>
<p>*******************************************</p>
<p class="p1">To truly understand <em>The Committee of Dubious Goals</em> and their socio-political influence on the community of <a href="/broadcliffs/">Broadcliffs</a>, we must start at the very beginning. The year is 1954, a small recreation hut on the site of the modest stadium of the <em>Broadcliffs Academicals</em>.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Mr Reginald Culpepper</em> (the president of said football team) is once again belittling the hard-working volunteers of this small sporting club. Anybody unfortunate enough to know him well would have happily told you <em>Mr Culpepper</em> was a bully and not a very nice person at all. It would have been hard to tell, what with the flushed face, irate voice and general levels of froth spewing from his mouth, but <em>Mr Culpepper</em> was thoroughly enjoying himself. He loved nothing better than shouting at people. He had taken it way past the level of a hobby, if you will, one might almost say when it came to shouting and crushing people&#8217;s souls, he was at a competitive professional level.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I will not bore you with the details, but life had not been kind to Reginald from his very beginning. That being said, through a mix of guile, aggression, and lack of empathy, <em>Mr Culpepper</em> had managed to drag himself from the gutter to be one of the richest men in Broadcliffs. His harsh background had not instilled within him an understanding of the struggles of his fellow human beings, rather a contempt of their inadequacies. He used his wealth and power like a weapon, one that he was welding with righteous indignation that fateful night.</p>
<p class="p1">At this point, I would like to highlight that the targets of this ire were not in themselves entirely without their own shortcomings.</p>
<p class="p1">Outwardly they might have seemed like upstanding pillars of the community, but each of the twelve that had gathered in that hut were miserable excuses for human beings. Each of them hated too, although in more minor more spiteful ways than <em>Mr Culpepper,</em> and they hid their hatred behind a veil of normalcy. I can only recount the histories of the few I had had the unfortunate fate of knowing personally.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, <em>Mr Donald McFoden</em>, the local butcher, loathed his customers, and if he wasn&#8217;t ripping them off with his adjusted scales, he was adding unspeakable things to his sausage mix.</p>
<p class="p1">Mr <em>Cecil Crump</em>, the park keeper, silently detested children and would often add broken bits of glass into the sandpit, then blame it on the teenagers who frequented the park.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Mrs Agnes Pugh</em>, an accountant&#8217;s secretary, was a scandalous gossip that spread awful rumours to anyone she felt had slighted her in any way. <em>Ms Majorie Simm</em>s was a fearsome schoolmistress who only smiled when canning some unfortunate child.</p>
<p class="p1">The rest had their petty hates and small acts of evils to list, trivial examples of jealousies and meanness. I will list their names for the sake of prosperity, <em>Aloysius Brown, Ethal and Stanley Cooper, Madeline Bucket, Morris Weinstacker, Zachary Jones, Louis Chambers, and Dr Joseph Rawlinson.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Individually, these twelve had gone through life committing these minor atrocities without significantly impacting society. But that night changed everything. <em>Mrs Agnes Pugh</em> was the first to stand up and looked coldly into those bloodshot eyes of <em>Mr Culpepper</em>. It acted like a catalyst, one by one, they all rose from their chairs.</p>
<p class="p1">This resulted in <em>Mr Culpepper</em> getting even more irate, his face reddening, his voice even louder, but they did not falter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">In the official history of the <em>Committee of Dubious Goals</em>, it is stated that the twelve acted instantly together and surged towards this tyrant as a single unit. Whether this telling is apocryphal or not, the result was the same.</p>
<p class="p1">The twelve tore him apart, grabbing and tearing at his clothes and flesh, ripping skin and gouging eyes. The carnage was horrendous, and by the time their bloodlust was sated, bits of Mr Culpepper were strewn across the meeting place.</p>
<p class="p1">There had been no one murderer, it had not been a single blow that had killed him, but their collective efforts had achieved the dastardly goal. And the group realised their collective guilt, and this communal blood was literally on all of their hands.</p>
<p class="p1">Then what can only be described as a miracle happened. This band of sociopaths realised that only by working together they could get away with this heinous crime. They started with a thorough cleaning of the now blood strewn hut. The body pieces were made into a very successful range of pork pies that were sold at a fundraising event. The sudden disappearance of <em>Mr Culpepper</em> was explained in a salacious rumour that was widely spread. His vast wealth was redistributed to the <em>Committee</em> by the sudden appearance of a new will.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Basking in the success of this perfect murder, the group decided they must carry on. Individually they realised their spiteful efforts amounted to very little, but together they were a genuinely fearsome force of evil.</p>
<p class="p1">Acknowledging their sporting roots and understanding the need to hide their nefarious schemes beneath a veneer of respectably, they called themselves <em>The Committee of Dubious Goals</em>. And so was born a truly terrible and powerful organisation, one whose influence permeates every level of this small to medium-sized seaside town of Broadcliffs.</p>
<p class="p1">Although, as I have previously stated, I had the displeasure of being aquatinted with some of the founding members of <em>The Committee of Dubious Goals</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">However, I was not at that time aware of their activities or the fact they were pivotal members of a secret organisation bent on world domination. If truth be told, I, like most Broadcliffs residents, was completely unaware that such a group existed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This was a complete dereliction of duty on my part, and I will report for summary execution when the rest of the <em>Glorious <a href="/kalaxions/">Kalaxion</a></em> Invasion Fleet arrives. It is a stain on my character and a shame I will carry into the next life. The signs that such an organisation might exist were there the whole time. There is even a religious Earth prophecy that states &#8216;the meek shall inherit the Earth&#8217;. It seems the meek got tired of waiting and took matters into their own hands.</p>
<p class="p1">Although once I did become aware of the organisation, I could see them everywhere. They were walking their dogs, sitting behind desks, standing at counters. The average person, the scene filler, so nondescript that their urban camouflage was almost complete.</p>
<p class="p1">But there were certain signs. As individuals, they knew their limits; their hatred of their fellow humans burned within them, but how could they express this? The usual sign was the micro-aggression, tiny, almost senseless acts of pettiness and vindictiveness. Nothing, of course, that could get themselves arrested or even generally noticed by their fellows as an intended brutal attack.</p>
<p class="p1">Examples would be the bank teller that tries to suppress a smile as she tells you your account is overdrawn. The Bus Driver that waits until the last moment before pulling away, leaving you to wait in the rain. And the classic sign of a nest of these social vipers, &#8220;Only two school children at a time&#8221;, posted in the corner shop window.</p>
<p class="p1">By the time I had become aware, even of their very existence, it was already too late… I was surrounded, deep within enemy territory, without even realising it. They were legion in number. The Meek were everywhere.</p>
<p class="p1">Only the expert training I received on Kalaxion kept me sane. The next step was obvious. I had to infiltrate their ranks. I do not wish to assume any false modesty, the suffering I endured on the next stage of my plan cannot be underestimated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I sat, for hours, in half-empty church halls, drafty school gymnasiums. I attended flower arranging classes and bridge clubs. Literally years of my life past in the scout&#8217;s hut with the arts and craft collective. I endured each one&#8217;s bizarre initiation rites. The blood sacrifices of the &#8216;Bell ringers of St. Lukes&#8217; is a sight that can never be unseen. The &#8216;Lawn bowling association&#8217;s brutal training regimes will always leave me with that recurring nightmare.</p>
<p class="p1">I worked my way up through the ranks of these various organisations, always with the conviction that there must be one central group that rules them all. I went on &#8216;terrifying&#8217; outings, helped out at &#8216;fundraisers&#8217;, I willingly joined the hordes of vile volunteers. And it wasn&#8217;t long before I began to get an understanding of the complex internal organisational structure of this so-called Committee.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The Committee comprises six subgroups; </strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em>The Steering Committee</em> is a shadowy group whose main brief is overall command and control. Little is known of these people, primarily where they recruit their members.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The Neighbourhood Watch&#8217;s</em> remit is security and surveillance and is unique in that its membership comprises of no known subgroups.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The Sports and Recreations Syndicate</em> make up the armed forces, special forces, and shock troops of the Committee.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The Arts and Crafts Brigade</em> cover the strategy and planning operations, a heinous task made worse by the fact it made up of some of the most horrific people you could ever come across.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Schools, Parks, and Council Workers</em> are mainly involved in the research and development needs the Committee might have.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The Small Business Community Group</em> oversee the finance and accounting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Each subgroup elects two members to the higher Committee every three years, along with the Chairman/woman.</p>
<p class="p1">The position of Chairman/woman is one of ultimate power. Due to the fact it is also an incredibly perilous position (usurpations and assassinations attempts are commonplace), the holder welds their power with often brutal force.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">It is an open secret that each group loathes every other group and constantly plots the other downfall. In fact, petty rivalries within each subgroup are notoriously common. An example is the turf war of &#8217;97 between <em>The Tuesday Knitting Circle</em> and the (now extinct Pavilion Library Thursday Morning Book Club.</p>
<p class="p1">In conclusion,<em> The Committee of Dubious Goals</em> is an exceptionally well funded and highly resourced organisation.</p>
<p class="p1">They are legion in number and could challenge Kalaxion ground forces. That being said, they are riven with internal fighting and politicking. The strength of this combined hatred is also their greatest weakness. If they could ever truly unite their forces, join in a single goal or aim, they would be a fearsome foe indeed. And perhaps our invasion might trigger such an event. This is one of the reasons why I have advocated in the past and will continue to press for, the complete annihilation of the human population of Broadcliffs using targeted biogenetic weapons. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p></div>

<p>‘Dead Dave’ is an active member of the NL+ (Non-Living) community of <a href="/broadcliffs-town/">Broadcliffs</a>. The NL+ recently changed their organisational name from Undead United of Broadcliffs. Firstly, because Dave argued that the term Undead contained the word dead (‘dead’ is considered a hate word by the NL+ community). Secondly, because the NL wanted to include other members post-existence, and various pandimensional beings. And thirdly because it sounded like a third division English football team.</p>
<p>Dead Dave is best known for his pungent stench; that, and his role at the change kiosk in the <a href="/amazon-arcade/">Amazon Arcade</a>. Although a being a &#8216;man&#8217; of few words, Dead Dave is an outspoken and active member of the NL+ and is considered by many to be a trailblazer in his attempts to integrate with the living. Dead Dave is also a known associate of <a href="/madame-morteau/">Madame Morteau</a>, the landlady of the Merry Dance and is linked with mysterious Mr Biscuit, a long-time resident of Broadcliffs and a known agent of chaos.</p></div>
